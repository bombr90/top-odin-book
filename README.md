# TOP: Odin-Book

The Odin Project - Assignment Odin-Book 

A MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) app for demonstrating a full-stack barebones 'social network' application (inspired by Facebook).

## [Live Demo]()

## Getting Started*
```
git clone https://github.com/bombr90/top-odin-book.git
cd top-blog-api
npm install
npm start
```

>**Note: You'll need to self-host a mongoDB database or have mongoDB atlas account with a valid DB connection string saved as an environmental variable. Create a '.env' file in the root directory in the following format:* 
>- DB_URI = "mongodb+srv://[yourUsername]:[myRealPassword]@cluster0.mongodb.net/blog-api?w=majority"
>- SECRET = [your JWT secret]
>- ADMINCODE = [your admin code]
>- MEMBERCODE = [your member code]

<!-- ## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment. -->
