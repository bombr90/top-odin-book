# TOP: Odin-Book

The Odin Project - Assignment Odin-Book 

A MERN (Mongo, Express, React, Node) app for demonstrating a full-stack barebones 'social network' application (inspired by Facebook).

## [Live Demo]()

## Getting Started*
```
git clone https://github.com/bombr90/top-odin-book.git
cd top-blog-api
npm install
npm start
```

>**Note: You'll need to self-host a mongoDB database or have mongoDB atlas account with a valid DB connection string saved as an environmental variable. Create a '.env' file in the root directory in the following format:* 
>- DB_URI = "mongodb+srv://[yourUsername]:[myRealPassword]@cluster0.mongodb.net/blog-api?w=majority"
>- SECRET = [your session secret]
>- SERVER_PORT = [your selected port - default 5000]
>- CLIENT_PORT = [your selected port - default 3000]
